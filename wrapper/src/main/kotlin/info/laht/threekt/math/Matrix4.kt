/**
 * A class representing a 4x4 matrix.
 *
 * The most common use of a 4x4 matrix in 3D computer graphics is as a Transformation Matrix. For an introduction to transformation matrices as used in WebGL, check out this tutorial.
 *
 * This allows a Vector3 representing a point in 3D space to undergo transformations such as translation, rotation, shear, scale, reflection, orthogonal or perspective projection and so on, by being multiplied by the matrix. This is known as	applying the matrix to the vector.
 *
 * Every Object3D has three associated Matrix4s:
 * Object3D.matrix: This stores the local transform of the object.
 * Object3D.matrixWorld: The global or world transform of the object. This is the object's transformation relative to its parent. If the object has no parent, then this is identical to the local transform.
 * Object3D.modelViewMatrix: This represents the object's transformation relative to the camera's coordinate system. An object's modelViewMatrix is the object's matrixWorld pre-multiplied by the camera's matrixWorldInverse.
 * Cameras have two additional Matrix4s:
 * Camera.matrixWorldInverse: The view matrix - the inverse of the Camera's matrixWorld.
 * Camera.projectionMatrix: Represents the information how to project the scene to clip space.
 * Note: Object3D.normalMatrix is not a Matrix4, but a Matrix3.
