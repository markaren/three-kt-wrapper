/**
 * Class representing a 3D vector. A 3D vector is an ordered triplet of numbers (labeled x, y, and z), which can be used to represent a number of things, such as:
 * A point in 3D space.
 * A direction and length in 3D space. In three.js the length will always be the Euclidean distance (straight-line distance) from (0, 0, 0) to (x, y, z) and the direction is also measured from (0, 0, 0) towards (x, y, z).
 * Any arbitrary ordered triplet of numbers.
 * There are other things a 3D vector can be used to represent, such as momentum vectors and so on, however these are the most common uses in three.js.
 *
 * @param x the x value of the vector. Default is 0.
 * @param y the y value of the vector. Default is 0.
 * @param z the z value of the vector. Default is 0.
