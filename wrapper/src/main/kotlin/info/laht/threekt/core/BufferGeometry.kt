/**
 * This class is an efficient alternative to Geometry, because it stores all data, including vertex positions,
 * face indices, normals, colors, UVs, and custom attributes within buffers; this reduces the cost of passing all
 * this data to the GPU.
 * This also makes BufferGeometry harder to work with than Geometry; rather than accessing position data as Vector3
 * objects, color data as Color objects, and so on, you have to access the raw data from the appropriate attribute buffer.
 * This makes BufferGeometry best-suited for static objects where you don't need to manipulate the geometry much
 * after instantiating it.
